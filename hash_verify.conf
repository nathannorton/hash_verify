# HASHII config file.
# 
# This file will get read each time the hashii application gets run.  
# 
# The do_hash section describes files that we would like to take a 
# hash of and send the results away for storing.
#
# The verify section describes files or directories that we would like 
# verify against data stored in the hashii database. There is an 
# optional config item here called "action" which will describe
# what to do once the file has been verified (action is not that advanced 
# yet, but will improve over time; maybe)
#
# A config can have either:
#  1. both do_hash and verify sections
#  2. only do_hash section
#  3. only verify section
#
#
# It should be noted that there are 3 cases for when we list a directory
# #   1. file is a directory, recursive set to "n"
# #           - this will work on contents of directory
# #   2. file is a directory, recursive set to "y"
# #           - this will do a recursive generation on all sub dirs
# #   3. file is a file, recursive set to "n"
# #           - will do only the listed file 
#
#
# It is in YAML format 
# Some Example configs.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generaly it is in the format of the following
#
#connection:
#    server: localhost
#    database: hash_verify
#    port: 27017
#    collection: hashes
#auth:
#    username: username
#    password: password
#do_hash:
#    - directory: /path to file/or/directory
#      recursive: y
#verify:
#    - directory: /tmp/test
#      recursive: n
#      action:    delete
#
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An example of a machine to only push hasheses to the database: 
#
#connection:
#    server: localhost
#    database: hash_verify
#    port: 27017
#    collection: hashes
#auth:
#    username: admin
#    password: pa55w0rd
#do_hash:
#    - directory: /export/pub/data/market/shopping/location8
#      recursive: y
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An example of pushing only, however we are doing multiple directories
#
#connection:
#    server: localhost
#    database: hash_verify
#    port: 27017
#    collection: hashes
#auth:
#    username: admin
#    password: pa55w0rd
#
#do_hash:
#   - directory: /export/pub/data/shopping/market/location2
#     recursive: n
#   - directory: /export/pub/data/shopping/market/location5
#     recursive: y
# NOTE: as above, the first one will do all files in the directory, but not 
#       sub directories, the second one will do both all files in dir and sub
#       directory.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An example of verifying only, we are verifying the files in /tmp/test (or 
# the file /tmp/test - if that is what it is), our action will delete if the 
# files are verified
#
#connection:
#    server: localhost
#    database: hash_verify
#    port: 27017
#    collection: hashes
#auth:
#    username: admin
#    password: pa55w0rd
#
#verify:
#   - directory: /tmp/test
#     recursive: n
#     action:    delete
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An example of doing both a publish and verify in one config
#
#connection:
#    server: localhost
#    database: hash_verify
#    port: 27017
#    collection: hashes
#auth:
#    username: admin
#    password: pa55w0rd
#do_hash:
#   - directory: /export/pub/data/shopping/market/location2
#     recursive: n
#   - directory: /export/pub/data/shopping/market/location5
#     recursive: y
#verify:
#   - directory: /tmp/test
#     recursive: n
#     action:    delete
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NOTES: 
# 1. if you stuff up your config and do both a verify and publish in the same config 
#    file you will essentially delete the item!
# 2. generally on silicon(master source)  we only want to do do_hash commands and 
#    on all the other nodes we want to do verifys 
#
